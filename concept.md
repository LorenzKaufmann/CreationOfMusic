# Game: Creation of Music

This game will first of be a multiplayer game. Therefor interactions between players is also limited in some way. 

Check-List:

- The multiplayer aspect should focus on hearing each others music blocks, but not be able to interfere/change anything the other player does on his "island". 
- There will be an option to turn off the audio of the other player.
- There will be an option to turn off the audio of individual blocks on your island.

## Multiplayer

Players can create private Rooms and play isolated from other players.

Thoughts:

- Each room needs to be uniquely identifiably.
- RealTime audio processing is needed so that the sounds are not delayed.
- The server needs to stream audio to all players in one room.
